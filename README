nsproxy
====================

nsproxy (namespace proxy) is a Linux-specific command-line tool, makes
applications force to use a specific SOCKS5 or HTTP proxy.

Functionally similar to tsocks / proxychains-ng / graftcp, but using a
totally different mechanism. It create a TUN device and launch applications in
a fresh network_namespace, then connect the TUN device to a user-mode TCP/IP
stack and redirect connections through proxy server outside the namespace.
Benefiting from the namespace mechanism, it doesn't require any privilege, and
will not affect other processes.

It has the following features:

 - Support SOCKS5 / HTTP proxy protocols.
 - Support TCP / UDP protocols.
 - Built-in DNS redirection.
 - Works perfectly on static linked applications.
 - No privilege required.


USAGE
----------

nsproxy [-H] [-s <server>] [-p <port>] [-u <username>] [-P <password>] [-d <dns>] [-v|-q] <command>

Examples:
  # Use socks5 proxy
  nsproxy dig example.com A

  # Use socks5 proxy with authentication
  nsproxy -u myuser -P mypass dig example.com A

  # Use http proxy
  nsproxy -H curl example.com


Options:
  -H
    Use http proxy, not socks5.
    Note: UDP is **NOT** supported in http proxy. UDP packets will drop and got
          an ICMP port unreachable message.

  -s <server>
    Proxy server address.
    Default value is "127.0.0.1"

  -p <port>
    Proxy server port.
    Default value is "1080" for socks, "8080" for http

  -u <username>
    SOCKS5 authentication username.
    Must be used together with -P <password>.

  -P <password>
    SOCKS5 authentication password.
    Must be used together with -u <username>.

  -d <dns>
    DNS redirect, allow following options:
      -d off
        Do nothings on DNS, treat as normal UDP packets.
      -d tcp://<nameserver_ipaddress>
        Redirect DNS requests to specified TCP nameserver.
      -d udp://<nameserver_ipaddress>
        Redirect DNS requests to specified UDP nameserver.
    Default value is "tcp://1.1.1.1"

  -v
    Verbose mode. Use "-vv" or "-vvv" for more verbose.

  -q
    Be quiet.

LIMITATIONS
----------

All {uid,gid} except the current user will be mapped to
"/proc/sys/kernel/overflow{uid,gid}". That means file owners except the current
user will be shown as 'nobody', and programs like sudo / su will not work.

nsproxy will create a new network_namespace for proxied application, so the
networking between inside and outside of the namespace is isolated. There's no
route to the inside of the namespace. It's unable to establish a connection to
the inside from the outside. In addition, abstract UNIX domain sockets are
isolated too.

Connections to loopback addresses will not be proxied, and those addresses are
not referenced to the host, they are referenced to the inside of the namespace.
